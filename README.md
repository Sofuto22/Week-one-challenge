# Updating code to increase accessibility

## Description

I started this project in order to improve on the accessibilty of a previous site adding in new semantic elements. This was in order to put a better structure in for different devices that only search for certain things on the page. While working on it I learned the importance of seperating out elements and how to correctly use their semantic tags while keeping the overall look of the page the same just with increased accessibility.

## Usage

The improved semantic coding of this page can be used for screen readers and other such devices in order to easily find certain parts of the page. This also will increase the search engine opitmization for visiblity.
